This TypeScript repository houses the backend code for a task management application. It's constructed using Express and is designed to offer RESTful API endpoints for managing tasks, including operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks. The server is built with strict type safety, leveraging TypeScript's type annotations across all variables and function parameters. Middleware for JSON parsing is configured to facilitate request handling, and comprehensive error handling and logging mechanisms are implemented to ensure robustness and ease of debugging. Furthermore, the server is integrated with a MongoDB database through Mongoose, enabling persistent storage and efficient data retrieval for tasks. This setup is engineered to run on a specified port, providing a scalable and maintainable backend solution for task management applications.
